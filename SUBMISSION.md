## Summary of Changes Made

### Bug Fixes Implemented
1. **Task Re-assignment Duplicates (Bug #1)**: Fixed the `assignByReference` method to properly assign one task to the new employee and cancel all duplicate tasks for the same reference and task type.

2. **Cancelled Tasks in Date View (Bug #2)**: Modified `fetchTasksByDate` to filter out tasks with CANCELLED status from the results.

### New Features Implemented
1. **Smart Daily Task View (Feature #1)**: Enhanced the date-based filtering logic to return:
   - All active tasks that started within the specified date range
   - All active tasks that started before the range but are still open (not completed)

2. **Task Priority Management (Feature #2)**: Added complete priority management:
   - `POST /task-mgmt/priority/update` - Update a task's priority
   - `GET /task-mgmt/priority/{priority}` - Fetch all tasks by priority level (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

3. **Task Comments & Activity History (Feature #3)**: Implemented comprehensive audit trail:
   - Automatic activity logging for all task operations (creation, status changes, priority changes, reassignments)
   - User comment system with `POST /task-mgmt/comment` endpoint
   - Enhanced task details endpoint to include complete chronological history of activities and comments

### Technical Improvements
- Proper Spring Boot project structure with clear separation of concerns
- Thread-safe in-memory repositories using ConcurrentHashMap
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Activity logging service for automatic audit trails
- Enhanced DTOs with support for activity history and comments
- MapStruct integration for clean object mapping

### Testing Notes
The application includes seed data that demonstrates the bugs and can be used to test the fixes:
- Reference ID 201 has duplicate tasks (for testing Bug #1 fix)
- Task ID 6 is a cancelled task (for testing Bug #2 fix)
- Various tasks with different start dates and priorities for comprehensive testing
